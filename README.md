I have a horrible memory and can never remember shortcut keys for all the various program/IM/Video/music/MS office programs I use.  

I wanted a small **dedicated visual** keyboard for my repeated functions/shortcut keys. I started dedicated USB keypad.  
It was usable and got me to 75% of what I wanted. Unfortunately, I found if you wanted to do anything that involved the built-in lights of the USB keyboard or *little-more* complicated functionality it required a minor degree in programming. In addition the program to run the dedicated USB keyboard ran horribly on Windows 10.  
I ended shifting my efforts to macro scripting languages. Now, The dedicated keyboard just simply launches my hacked scripts. 
I now use the Elgato Stream Deck which work great on Windows 10. In addition the Stream deck allows for visual toggle updates.

Here is small, but I believe useful (at least useful to me) collection of scripts. I am not a programmer by trade, but have enough skills to hack together scripts. My hacking scripts, or bodging, inspiration is as follows below. I am aware that AutoHotKey is a bit dated, but it works for me. I might get around to updating it to AutoIt at a later date.
